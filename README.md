# dedicated-purpose-server
      a part of the special project

The server will have two endpoints:

- addMessage

- pollMessage

1. /addMessage: It will POST, accept a base64 body and generate an ID for accessing this message, and return that ID as the response of the request. The message that comes with the /addMessage will be kept in memory for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes the message will be deleted automatically.


2. /pollMessage: It will be used to access the message generated by add message. Its parameter will be the ID that generated from /addMessage. The return value will be the base64 version of the message. The message will not be deleted with the poll message. The message will only be deleted 15 minutes after it is added.
